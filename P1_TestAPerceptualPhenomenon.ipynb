    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color: red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color: blue\">BLUE</span>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color: #6AA84F\">PURPLE</span>, <span style=\"color: #674EA7\">ORANGE</span>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition."
